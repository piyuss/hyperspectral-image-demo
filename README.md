The file hyperspectral_image_demo.ipynb is a Google notebook document that you can open on your browser. Any required libraries and files are downloaded within the notebook itself. If you choose to run the notebook locally, several Python libraries will need to be installed (these are pre-installed when using Google Colab.)
